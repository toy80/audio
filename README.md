An experimental golang audio library, provide an Ogg-Vorbis decoder and an OpenAL-based playback interface.
It was designed for a 3D game engine.

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/toy80/go-al/...
```

## Usage

### Ogg+Vorbis Decoding

set [github.com/toy80/go-al/vorbis/example-ogg2wav](https://github.com/toy80/go-al/blob/master/vorbis/example-ogg2wav/example-ogg2wav.go)

```golang
package main

import (
  // ...
  "github.com/toy80/go-al/vorbis"
  "github.com/toy80/go-al/wav"
)

// ...

func convert(name string) {
  //...
  f, err := vorbis.Open(name)
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    os.Exit(1)
  }
  defer f.Close()

  //...
  if err = wav.WriteFile(name+".wav", f); err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
    os.Exit(1)
  }
}

// ...

```

### Audio Playback

see [github.com/toy80/go-al/aplay/example-play-wav](https://github.com/toy80/go-al/blob/master/aplay/example-play-wav/example-play-wav.go)

```golang
package main

import (
  // ...
  "github.com/toy80/go-al/aplay"
  "github.com/toy80/go-al/wav"
)

func main() {
  if len(os.Args) != 2 {
    log.Fatalln("Usage: example-play-wav WAV_FILE")
  }
  defer aplay.WaitIdle()

  sound, err := wav.Open(os.Args[1])
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err)
  }
  defer sound.Close()

  player := aplay.Alloc()
  if err = player.Play(sound, 1, 0); err != nil {
    log.Fatalln(err)
  }

  time.Sleep(sound.Duration() + time.Second)
}

```
